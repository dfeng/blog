It's seems somewhat depressing that I only remember my favorite books as a kid when their authors die. It happened first with Brian Jacques and the Redwall series, and now today with Terry Pratchett and the Discworld series. I think the Redwall series made a deeper and more profound impact on me, as I started reading that earlier in my childhood, but Discworld definitely shaped my personality, especially in the humor department.

In tribute, I will revisit the wonderful world that is Discworld, starting with Guards! Guards!
