What better way to celebrate the holidays than to stuff a gargantuan poultry with the remains of another animal and let it sit in its own juices inside a decidedly hot compartment for three and a half hours before taking it out and placing it in the centerpiece of the dining table to commemorate the valiant effort in procuring the beast from the jaws of the frozen food section of the local supermarket and then ceremonially butchering it into slices of delicious, tender roast meat.

I end this holiday post with a message from the [Communist Party](http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/atheist-china-cracks-down-on-a-force-of-the-west-christmas/).

> Christmas is a tinsel-draped Trojan horse that aims to subvert traditional Chinese culture.

Happy Holidays.
