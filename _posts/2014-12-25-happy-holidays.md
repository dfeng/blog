What better way to celebrate the holidays than to stuff a gargantuan poultry with the remains of another animal and let it sit in its own juices inside a desperately hot compartment for three and a half hours before taking it out and placing it in the centerpiece of the dining table 
 ripping it to tiny strands and serving it with a dash of cranberry sauce. Happy days.
