It was Christmas Eve, our last day in Copenhagen. The weather was being commendably consistent in its disinterest towards the toteful of tourists remaining in the town, spreading a blanket of cloud and drizzle throughout the town. We were hungry. Hungry and without options, as the Danes are not as resourceful as the Chinese, the great businessmen who never close on holidays but who unfortunately lack presence in Scandinavia.

This doesn't happen very often, but the French saved the day.
