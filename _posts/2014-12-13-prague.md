Cities are [living organisms](http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_living_city/), each with their particular personality. Prague is schizophrenic. Sometimes it is the once-upon-a-time cultured grandfather who now sits on the porch handing out racist glares to passerbys. Other times it is a empty human vessel for alcohol and sex, cleverly disguised as the youth.

Like many cities in Europe, it clings to its rich and eminent tapestry of a past like a bankrupt stock trader to his last pair of polished wingtips -- the last vestige of a bygone prosperity. History has shifted. It used to be a 2-dimensional random walk. Those mathematically inclined will know that this process has the nice property that it is guaranteed to return to glory (provided you wait long enough). However, in the 21st century, globalization and the collected works of Christopher Nolan have increased the effective dimension of history to that very special number 3, and we all know that famous adage, 

> a drunk bird will never find its way home.

Prague had its multiple affairs with prosperity and conflagration. No longer.

Any legitimate Civilization V player will tell you that focusing all your efforts on accumulating Culture will only bring about defeat. There needs to be diversity in your society's production. Prague boasts a tremendous array of Culture. Kafka.

### Cuisine

The Czech cuisine can be characterized by a fun pun:

> a cuisine where ends meat.

Haha.

Nearly all the traditional dishes are different masks of the same being. Like a spoiled infant, the traces of vegetables are either hidden in mounds of flour, or are so devoid of flavor that they become like what rice is to the Chinese -- something to pair with the meat so as to balance the salinity and richness of the main course. The best food we had involved either Italian Gelato, vegetarian Czech food (an oxymoron among oxymorons), and fresh oysters from Ireland.

<!-- The trouble with Prague is one of *perception*. -->

The trouble with Prague is that it has an *image* problem. Mentioning Prague to other Europeans evoke visuals of a shady underground clubhouse where the motto is

> what happens in Prague stays in Prague.

Yes, that's the motto for Las Vegas. But at least Las Vegas has that gambling gig going for it.

Unfortunately, perception is hard to change, as Chinese restaurant owners know all to well. That is why a ramen place can sell the same noodle dish, except with the addition of two strands of dried seaweed, for 10x the markup without anybody calling the food cops.
